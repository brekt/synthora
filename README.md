# synthora

## A Musical AI World written in TypeScript, using THREE.jS and the Web Audio API.

The orbs, known as Iotas, vote democratically to determine the shape of the music.
When they come in contact with each other they influence one another, and then they
vote on changes to be me made to the music for the next period of time, say 8 measures.
In this way the music evolves, generatively, from an intial direction set by a user
visiting the app.
